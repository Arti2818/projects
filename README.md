According to a study on real-time price prediction, the earlier method is insufficient for providing information and a solution for predicting price changes. People in business or investors who want risk when making investments. We develop a machine learning-based technique to price prediction for a financial institution to address these issues with people-related digital currencies price prediction. The Y Finance API is present in the anticipated system, allowing users to retrieve stock and financial data.
The LSTM algorithm is used to anticipate price prediction for daily, weekly and monthly. This system works with 20 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple, Tether, IOTA, Monero, and others.
The results demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed system, which outperforms existing algorithms in terms of price prediction accuracy. Trading cryptocurrencies has been easier in recent years. People all across the world now have access to powerful computing thanks to the various cryptocurrencies' success in price prediction.
